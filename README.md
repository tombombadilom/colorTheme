# colorTheme

Simple project to:
- Explore libs that let you combine colors in harmony.
- Create color palettes and a shacdn/ui theme
- Visualize:
  - On solid background,
  - On transparent backgrounds with canvas webgl background animations and web worker. 
- Made it compatible with Light and Dark mode

(To do this, I took the example pages and components from shacdn-ui and transposed them from Next.js to React + vite 5).
