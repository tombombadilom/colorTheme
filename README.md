# colorTheme

## About this project
I'm not a designer, I don't have much artistic culture and I've always worked with good professionals who knew how to see and choose the right colors at the start of a project. 

But sometimes I create projects just to test the technology, no branding, no values, just code.

From all the years I've worked with art directors, graphic designers and photographers, I've retained the ability to see when colors aren't harmonious, but it still takes me a long time to choose and define a theme. In the meantime, my project doesn't move forward, because I keep coming back to the theme over and over again. 

So this time I decided, even if it meant wasting time, to explore libs using color theories. Admittedly, this will never replace the expertise and eye of a trained human, but at least it will enable me to make faster progress on my code with a more or less homogeneous theme. 
 
At the moment, I'm using Tailwindcss and Shacdn/ui, which I find to be remarkably well coded, so why not a color configurator with those?

## What it does
colorTheme is a simple project to:
- Explore libs that let you combine colors in harmony.
- Create color palettes and a shacdn/ui theme
- Visualize:
  - On solid background,
  - On transparent backgrounds with canvas webgl background animations and web worker. 
- Made it compatible with Light and Dark mode

(To do this, I took the example pages and components from shacdn-ui and transposed them from Next.js to React + vite 5).
